# 0x4447-product-s3-drive

A stack to create a basic network drive using S3, while enabling all the useful features to make the experience complete.

# How to work with this project

When you want to deploy the stack, the only file you should be interested in is the `CloudFormation.json` file. If you'd like to modify the stack, we recommend that you use the [Grapes framework](https://github.com/0x4447/0x4447-cli-node-grapes), which was designed to make it easier to work with the CloudFormation file. If you'd like to keep your sanity, never edit the main CF file ðŸ¤ª.
